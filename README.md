The application is a straightforward console-based program developed with Python and Pandas libraries. Its purpose is to generate a .txt file once a customer has made a successful purchase. The process begins with the user selecting and purchasing the desired items. If any requested commodities are unavailable, the user receives a notification and can choose a quantity within the stock limit. Once the items have been selected, the application calculates the total cost and generates the bill for the customer.
